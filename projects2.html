<h1 id="potential-projects-in-complexity-theory">Potential Projects in Complexity Theory</h1>
<h2 id="project-requirement">Project Requirement</h2>
<ul>
<li>The final project is done by yourself or with at most 2 others.</li>
<li>This will consist of a project proposal (1-2 pages), periodic project progress updates (1-2 pages), a final project paper (at least 5 pages), and a final presentation in class. Due dates can be seen at https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/6.841-2022/.</li>
<li>At the dates they are due, the project proposal, progress updates, and final project paper should be emailed to the course instructor (<a href="rrw@mit.edu">Ryan</a>) and the TAs (<a href="nikhilv@mit">Nikhil</a> and <a href="naysh@mit.edu">Shyan</a>).</li>
<li>Your project could be a survey of a complexity-related topic we haven’t covered in class, or it consist of a new theorem (or set of new propositions) about some complexity-related topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="claiming-projects">Claiming Projects</h2>
<p>Guidelines for survey and research projects are listed below, but as soon as you have an idea for what paper(s) you’d like to base your project on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirm that you project has not been already claimed:</strong> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYN8xYcSXyqw1jiJh4VmiTWdA3tfPf_aYrYYHCoqKBg/edit?usp=sharing.</li>
<li>Email the course TAs (<a href="nikhilv@mit">Nikhil</a> and <a href="naysh@mit.edu">Shyan</a>) with your name, the names of any others in your group (if you ware working with others), and the names of the papers you’re interested in working through. If you are interested in more collaborators for your project you can let us know that in the email.</li>
<li>Please send this email as soon as you have a good sense of what papers you’d like to read for the project. In particular, it’s good to email and claim which paper(s) you’re interested before the actual project proposal deadline, to avoid overlapping too much with other students’ projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidelines-for-reading-survey-projects">Guidelines For Reading (Survey) Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>In general, you are allowed to pick any complexity-related topic (that is not covered in class) that interests you (but check with us first!).</li>
<li>You are encouraged to study several interesting frontier papers on that topic, and compose them into a survey with a coherent story. Of course, if you find recent papers too hard to read (which is very possible), you can also pick some older and more reader-friendly papers.</li>
<li>You are of course not required to prove all the things in the surveyed papers. You can just give the high-level ideas of the proofs, and/or omit technical things which in your opinion won’t help the reader to understand things better.</li>
<li>Even if you are doing a survey, we are expecting something <em>new and original</em> from you. You should put your efforts into the survey so that the exposition there has some <strong>advantage over the original papers</strong> (in other words, your survey should make people <strong>want to read your survey instead of the original papers</strong>).</li>
<li>Please remember that <strong>copying is plagiarism, and you should not do it</strong>. Ryan reads <strong>LOTS</strong> of papers, and is likely to tell if a section is copied from a paper you have read.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guideline-for-research-projects">Guideline For Research Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since complexity theory is considered to be a hard subject, we recommend you to study many previous works on your research topic first so that if you end up with no new theorems, it can be smoothly changed to a reading project.</li>
<li>Please don’t use a project which you are already working on as the course project. But you are encouraged to connect your research field to the course material, and start a project based on that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-list">Project List</h2>
<ul>
<li>The project list below offers some suggestions on potential research or reading topics. It is absolutely OK if you want to pick another topic which is not listed below. But make sure your topic is complexity-related (remember, check with us to make sure it is related!).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="circuit-lower-bounds">Circuit Lower Bounds</h2>
<h4 id="the-algorithmic-methods-towards-circuit-lower-bounds">The Algorithmic Methods Towards Circuit Lower Bounds</h4>
<p>The algorithmic method connects non-trivial circuit analysis algorithms and circuit lower bounds. The following two works establish a connection between <span class="math inline">\(2^{n-n^{\varepsilon}}\)</span>–time circuit analysis algorithms and lower bounds for non-deterministic quasi-polynomial time.</p>
<p><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/easy-witness-nqp.pdf">Circuit Lower Bounds for Nondeterministic Quasi-Polytime: An Easy Witness Lemma for NP and NQP</a></p>

<p>The following paper shows how to extend the above methods in the case of average-case complexity (note: this is longer and more technical than prior work):</p>
<p><a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/010/">Strong Average-Case Circuit Lower Bounds from Non-trivial Derandomization</a></p>
<p>In the following two works, the authors apply the algorithmic method to prove lower bounds against certain exact / approximation linear combinations of simple functions.</p>

<h4 id="hardness-magnification">Hardness Magnification</h4>
<p>Hardness magnification is a striking phenomenon which shows that <em>weak</em> fixed-polynomial lower bounds (say, <span class="math inline">\(n^{1+\varepsilon}\)</span>) for certain problems can be <em>magnified</em> to strong super-polynomial lower bounds, and therefore suggests a way to solving some long-standing open problems in complexity theory.</p>

<h2 id="fine-grained-complexity">Fine-Grained Complexity</h2>
<h4 id="hardness-of-approximation-in-fine-grained-complexity">Hardness of Approximation in Fine-Grained Complexity</h4>
<p>The past few years have seen conjectures from fine-grained complexity being used to prove interesting hardness results for various approximation problems, using interesting reduction frameworks. A good starting paper in this area is the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06407">Distributed PCP Theorems for Hardness of Approximation in <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{P}\)</span></a></p>
<h4 id="algebraic-methods-in-fine-grained-complexity">Algebraic Methods in Fine-Grained Complexity</h4>
<p>The program of fine-grained complexity is very successful at exact problems (problems in which an exact solution is sought). But we know less about the exact running time of approximation problems in <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{P}\)</span>. To resolve these questions there are recent works apply algebraic methods to fine-grained complexity.</p>
<p>This paper and the references therein offer some applications of this type:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00901">On Closest Pair in Euclidean Metric: Monochromatic is as Hard as Bichromatic</a></p>
<p>The following paper is a sort of “sequel” to the one above, and provides hardness of approximation for some more general problems using some similar, but more sophisticated, arguments:</p>

<p>Relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization present some barriers to proving certain lower bounds. The following recent paper takes a complementary view and, among other results, demonstrates some <em>necessary</em> conditions and implications of proving certain lower bounds:</p>

<p>This line of work proves several concrete lower bounds for the MCSP problem. They show that most state-of-the-art circuit lower bounds can be proved for the MCSP problems as well.</p>

<h4 id="average-case-to-worst-case-reduction-for-mcsp">Average-Case to Worst-Case Reduction for MCSP</h4>
<p>A fundamental problem in complexity is whether there is a worst-case to average-case reduction for NP-complete problems. It has been shown that black-box reductions (which captures most of the previous reductions in complexity theory) cannot establish worst-case to average-case reductions for problems outside of <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{NP} \cap \textsf{coNP}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the following significant work, worst-case to average-case reduction is shown for a certain version of MCSP problem, which is believed to be not in <span class="math inline">\(\textsf{NP} \cap \textsf{coNP}\)</span>.</p>

<h4 id="np-hardness-for-mcsp-problems">NP-Hardness for MCSP Problems</h4>
<p>Whether MCSP is NP-complete is an annoyingly open question in complexity theory. While the answer is still not clear, some works are showing certain variants of MCSP is NP-complete, and some other works showing there is circuit lower bounds barrier for proving MCSP is NP-complete.</p>
